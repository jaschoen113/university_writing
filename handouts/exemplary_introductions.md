#Examples of First Paragraphs for the Critical Response Essay

> It is rare for a writer to put his or her theory at risk by exposing its secret vulnerability, to set out on that fragile, shaky wooden bridge stretching across a chasm — the gap between the two cliffs of understanding. Daunting is the possibility of trust collapsing. One would be a fool to turn one’s idea against oneself. Yet, Jeffrey Cohen leads readers of his essay, “Monster Culture,” on this bridge of uncertainty when he poses a polarizing question that could either make the readers believe him completely or doubt his entire theory: “Do monsters really exist?” (20).

> In “Maid to Order: The Politics of Other Women’s Work,” Barbara Ehrenreich examines the social consequences of maid service in America through a seemingly feminist lens. She begins her essay with an account of the second-wave feminism that caused male and female responsibility within the domestic sphere to be reassessed. The “radical, post-Friedan cohort of feminists” considered the question, ‘Who does the housework?’ to really mean, ‘Who has the power to make their spouse do the housework?’ (Ehrenreich 61). These women believed that excusing the male from domestic responsibility was a “formula for reproducing male domination from one generation to the next” (61). In order to relieve this tension, couples hired household maids who were restorers of “tranquility as well as order to the home” (62). Ehrenreich views this outsourcing of upper class relationship issues as enabling the creation of a servant class. Over the course of the essay, she moves away from discussing the conflict of gender presented in housework and ceases to mention men as part of the equation. Ehrenreich instead focuses on a class issue—one in which the female homeowner is the villain, laying the foundation for generations of negligent children, and the female maid is the underdog that earns our sympathy and nostalgic appreciation for the hard physical labor that was once the responsibility of our mothers.
