##Exercise 2b: Exploratory Draft

- Word limit: __1500__-__1800__

###Objectives

1. Explore the implications of your __exhibit__ and their relevance to the issues discussed in the three essays that we have read so far.
2. Discover new potential __connections__ between the essays that we have read.
3. Identify initial and a revised interpretive __problems__, persuasive pieces of __evidence__, local and global __claims__, and a __motive__ for your own essay.

###Text

1. Settle on one of the three exhibits that you have found so far, or on a new one. Consider again its __manageability__, its __relevance__, and its __ambivalence__ (or _polysemy_).
2. Describe the exhibit adequately in your draft, presupposing a reader that may or may not be familiar with it.
3. Discuss your exhibit, its implications, and its potential connections to the essays that you have read. You should refer to at least two readings from this progression; in addition, you may also refer to either of the essays from the first progression.
4. Try to include the rhetorical elements that we have already used for the first progression: one interpretive problem, an initial claim, appropriate evidence, and a motive.
5. Use this draft to experiment new ideas. Write freely and do not focus on the formal qualities of this document. Exhaust every idea, do not give anything for granted, and justify every move thoroughly.
6. Start a new paragraph whenever you change your focus. Stop only when you feel that you have reached a satisfying, surprising conclusion.
