###Exercise __1d__: Two reader-oriented passages, and a revised argumentative scaffolding

- Word limit: ~700 w.

####Objectives

- Apply the strategies of _reader-oriented prose_ to your own writing.

- Start working on your _Formal draft_.

####Text

1. Review the notes that you have collected from our last class. Recall the main features of _reader-oriented prose_ as opposed to _writer-oriented prose_, and read carefully the comments that you have added to your own draft.

1. Transcribe and rearrange your tentative _argumentative scaffolding_. How would you revise it? Does it deliver information in the most effective way, or in the way that is most considerate ("well-mannered") towards your reader? Is it _logical_ (not _narrative_), and does it convey information and emphasis properly?

1. Start fleshing out the finite sentences that constitute your scaffolding, stressing delicate transitions and moments which require more thought. Then pick two paragraphs about whose contents you feel especially confident (they may or may not be the first two), and rewrite them while keeping in mind the principles of _reader-oriented prose_ (avoid _code-words_ and _narrative_ structure).
