#Exercise 1e: Formal Draft

- Word limit: 1500 w.

##Objectives

- Finalize the polished __scaffolding__ document that will become the blueprint of your final draft.

- Complete a __formal draft__ for at least __two thirds__ of your essay.

##Text

1. Review your scaffolding document and the two formal paragraphs that you have prepared for our last class. Take some time to consider the general structure again. You should have a list of about __eight__ to __ten__ rhetorical moves, arranged in a clear argumentative sequence.

2. Expand at least __two thirds__ of these points into formal paragraphs (_at least_ six to eight). These should function as polished, self-sufficient units, with a local introduction, a development and a conclusion.

	- Feel free to expand the rest of the paper as well, even if in a more informal way; for the remaining third free-writing is acceptable as well.
		
	- The document should be self-explanatory. We will workshop it in pairs next week, so that a  typed __hard copy__ of both parts (scaffolding and formal revision) will be __indispensable__ in our next class.

3. Send this draft to my email (gs2745@columbia.edu), and print out a hard copy to bring it to class.
