#Exercise 1c: Exploratory Draft

- Word limit: 1000-1500 words

##Objectives:

- Explore your __interpretive problem__ in order to discover what will become the __global claim__ of your _critical response essay_.

- Start structuring your essay; distinguish between paragraphs that contain _problems_, _claims_, _evidence_, and _motive_; consider the connections between them.


##Text:

1. Think about the work that you have done for the two essays that we have analyzed so far: _Monster Culture (Seven Theses)_ and _"We Would Not Have Come Without You": Generations of Nostalgia_. You should have an interpretive problem and the beginning of a hermeneutic circle for both. Ask yourself which problem you would like to explore further, and decide on one of the two texts. This will become the focus of your first graded essay.

2. Review the assignment that you have written for your chosen text, either an annotated _interpretive problem_ or a developed _hermeneutic circle_. Distinguish between _initial problem_ (an explicit question) and _initial claim_ (an explicit statement), and write them down as the head of your draft.

3. Now identify a series of questions that you want to address in your _exploratory draft_, and write them down as well. What broad problems will it discuss? What specific passages will it analyze?

4. Write your draft; remember that this is an _informal_ and _exploratory_ document. You will probably end up rewriting most or all of it. Do not aim at polished prose for now. Focus instead on your thoughts, and try to __exhaust__ each one of them. Slowly develop every consequence and every implication; _do not give anything for granted_.

	- Start a new paragraph every time you _do something new_.

	- Carefully and explicitly expand every _argumentative connection_ (transition). What logical reason led you from each thought to the following one? Make this obvious for your reader.

	- For now, try to keep _problems_, _claims_, _evidence_, and _motive_ apart; each paragraph should be devoted to one of these _moves_.

	- Begin with the discussion of your first _interpretive problem_, and finish with what you feel should be your _global claim_. Do not worry about formal introductions and conclusions.
