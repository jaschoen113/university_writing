#University Writing: Contemporary Essay
##Assignment One: Critical Response

- Due __Sunday, October 4th 2015__.

Pick a passage from “Monster Culture: Seven Theses” or “We Would Not Have Come Without You” that contains an __interpretive problem__ you wish to explore (as we will discuss in class, a problem can take the form of a tension, an ambiguity, a contradiction, or a site of possible misunderstanding). The passage can be as short as a single paragraph and should not be longer than a single page. Make a claim about how the writer’s choices of _language_ and _form_ affect the argument. Your analysis should stay close to the text, using the methods and terminology we discuss in class. 

The paper should be __1500-1800__ words long (include a word count at the end of each draft).

Goals:
- Identify a __problem__ that is worth addressing, using a passage that will reward close reading.
- Formulate a __claim__ that makes a strong argument and is not obvious.
- Establish a __motive__ for the essay in your introduction. Here you will answer the “So What?” question, suggesting why your essay is important and interesting to an intelligent reader. Draw out the implications of the argument in your conclusion.
- Structure the essay around your _central claim_, making sure that each paragraph is adding an essential piece to your argument.
- Use __evidence__ persuasively, quoting from the text when necessary, summarizing or paraphrasing accurately and responsibly when appropriate. Do not provide evidence from other sources or make general assertions (e.g., claims about “human nature”).
