#Assignment Two: Conversation Essay

- Due __Sunday, March 20th 2016__

Find an exhibit (see note below) that uses the word or concept of “education” or any variation of this word: e.g., “educator,” “educative,” etc. Make a claim about how “education” is being used and what it means in the context of your exhibit. Your argument should offer a close reading of your exhibit that engages the varying positions of 2-4 course readings that explore the meaning of “education.” By orchestrating and contributing to a scholarly conversation surrounding the meaning of “education,” your essay should bring the reader to a new understanding of your exhibit in relation to that conversation.

A note about vocabulary: An “exhibit” can be a text, an event, a performance, a speech, an image, or anything that can be interpreted and carries the potential for rich analysis. We use the term “exhibit” rather than “example” to connote a site of sustained and expansive engagement. While an example merely affirms an argument, an exhibit is dynamic; indeed, the exhibit itself may raise problems with our status quo understanding. Through careful analysis, our developing ideas about the exhibit may change or challenge our initial assumptions.

The paper should be 1500-2000 words long (include a word count at the end of each draft).

##Goals:

- Continue to work on the goals from the first assignment: using the __introduction__ to orient the reader and identify a textual __problem__; formulating a strong __claim__; establishing a __motive__; maintaining a coherent __structure__; using __evidence__ fairly and persuasively.

- Integrate your __sources__ with deliberation and purpose. The sources can be used to establish the motive, provide __key terms__, support your claim, or argue with other interpretations. Document sources using the MLA in-text citation method. Include a works cited page. Practice __ICE__: introduce, cite, explain. At least two of the sources should come from the second progression.

- Have __cohesion__ and __coherence__ in your prose on the sentence level and on the paragraph level. Your diction should be precise. Avoid clichés of language and clichés of thought.

- Have an interesting and informative __title__.
