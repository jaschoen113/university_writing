#University Writing: Contemporary Essays

##Assignment Four: Writing beyond University 

- Due Wednesday __December 16th__ 2015

Radically revise one of the pieces you’ve written for this class into an op-ed article that you will submit to a publication of your choice. Write a persuasive essay that articulates a clear intellectual __problem__ and makes a strong __claim__ in response to this problem. The essay should show familiarity with the work of experts and engage in the current scholarly conversation. Adhere to the style of the publication you’re writing for. Finally (and crucially), submit your article for publication. Most publications will not take op-ed pieces over 750 words.

##Goals:

- Continue to work on the goals from the first three assignments: using the __introduction__ to identify an intellectual __problem__ and to orient the reader to your __stance__; formulating a strong __claim__; establishing a clear __motive__; maintaining a __coherent__ and __cohesive__ structure; supporting your argument with __evidence__; writing in a fluent and clear __style__ that avoids cliché; smoothly integrating and analyzing critical and theoretical __sources__; explaining __key terms__; having an interesting and informative __title__.

- __Distill__ your most important ideas into clear, concise prose that will appeal to the specific __audience__ you have identified. 

- Produce your __greatest__ piece of writing. Ever. 

- Get __published__!
