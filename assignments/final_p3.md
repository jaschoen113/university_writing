#University Writing: Contemporary Essays

##Assignment Three: Research Essay

- Due Sunday __December 6th__ 2015

Using Susan Sontagâ€™s _Looking at War_ as a seed text, identify an intellectual __problem__ that this article raises (either implicitly or explicitly). Find and close read an __exhibit__ that emblematizes, addresses, or complicates this problem. Write a persuasive essay that makes a strong __claim__ and uses __evidence__ from six to ten sources. The essay should show familiarity with the work of experts and engage in the current scholarly conversation. Document sources using the MLA in-text citation method. 

The paper should be __2500-3000__ words long.

Goals:

1. Continue to work on the goals from the first two assignments: using the __introduction__ to orient the reader and identify an intellectual __problem__, formulating a strong __claim__, establishing a clear __motive__, maintaining a coherent __structure__, supporting your argument with __evidence__, writing in a fluent and clear style, smoothly integrating critical and theoretical sources, explaining __key terms__, having an interesting and informative title.

2. Offer an __analysis__ of the secondary sources, interpreting their central claims, evaluating their arguments, and explaining their significance in terms of your own claim.

3. __Reflect__ on your argument: consider counterarguments and draw out implications.
