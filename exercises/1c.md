#Exercise 1c: Exploratory draft

- Word limit: 800-1000 w.

##Text

Write a partial draft of three pages that includes at least two pages of polished prose. The unpolished sections of the partial draft can take the form of an outline or notes, though __the general shape and argument of your paper should be apparent__. Continue to think about the __central problem__ that you are exploring. Is the problem resolved? Is the resolution (or absence of resolution) significant to the argument? Think about the motive of your claim. How does your claim and analysis help us to understand the textâ€™s ideas in a new way?

###Tips

- Remember that this is an __informal document__. Focus on __content__ rather than form. 

- You do not need to write a formal introduction for now. Simply start by presenting your problem.

- Begin a new paragraph every time you do something new.

- Carefully expound each transition. Do not take any logical step for granted.
