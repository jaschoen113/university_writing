#Exercise 1a: Summary and one interpretive problem

- Word limit: 400 w.

##Text

1. Print out and carefully read the essay _Tense Present_ by David Foster Wallace (you will find it in the _Syllabus_ section of our CourseWorks page).

1. In two to three sentences, summarize the essay by describing the author's main claims and intentions.

1. Carefully choose a short passage that youâ€™d like to investigate. As we have discussed in class, you should look for a __tension__, an __ambiguity__ or a __contradiction__ in the text. Underline words and phrases that are especially resonant; as you annotate, think about the __meaning__ and __purpose__ of the passage. Write notes to explain your process of __close reading__, gradually expounding each transition from __observations__ (textual clues) to __claims__ (your own deductions).

1. Pose one potential __interpretive problem__ concerning the passage. Why does it interest you? What is the ostensible argument? What language in the passage seems especially rich, interesting, ambiguous, or problematic?
