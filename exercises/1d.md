#Exercise 1d: Revised scaffolding and two formal paragraphs

- Word limit: ~700 w.

##Text

1. Revise your exploratory draft from the perspective of _Reader-Based prose_.

	> Reader-Based prose is a deliberate attempt to communicate something to a reader. To do that it creates a __shared language__ and __shared context__ between writer and reader. It also offers the reader __an issue-centered rhetorical structure__ rather than a replay of the writer's discovery process. In its language and structure, Reader-Based prose reflects the _purpose_ of the writer's thought; Writer-Based prose tends to reflect its _process_.

2. Transcribe and rearrange your tentative _argumentative scaffolding_ (outline). Does it follow a __logical structure__ rather than a narrative one?

3. Following the principles of Reader-Based prose, add two polished formal paragraphs to your exploratory draft, or choose and rewrite two of the ones that you already have.
