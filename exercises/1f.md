#Exercise 1f: Peer review of your peer's formal draft

- Word limit: ~300 w.

##Text

Come to class having printed out and carefully read the paper assigned to you. Mark up the paper in the following way:

1. Underline sentences that you think work especially well.

2. Draw a squiggly line under sentences that you think need rephrasing.

3. Place an asterisk in the margin next to ideas that need to be further developed.

4. Type comments of at least 150 words that:

	1. Identify a moment in the paper that is particularly insightful or important. Say why. How does it change your understanding of the text?
	2. Identify a moment in the paper after the first page that you wish had come earlier in the essay. Say why. Where might it be moved?

	- Upload these comments to your Drop Box on CourseWorks. Bring a copy of these comments to class to give to the writer.

5. You may handwrite on the draft any other comments that you think would be helpful.
