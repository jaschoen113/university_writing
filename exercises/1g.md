- Word limit: ~1500 w.

##Text

1. As you read your formal draft again, consider the feedback that you have received in class and during conferences.

2. Identify two or more __higher order concerns__ that you need to address promptly. List them at the head of your new draft.

3. Revise your draft twice, trying to address at least two of these concerns. Rewrite, add, or delete those passages where these issues are most conspicuous.

4. Add a short note (two or three sentences) where you explain what you have done - and what you still need to do.
